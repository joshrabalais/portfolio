        I am a self-taught front-end developer. Being a self-taught developer means that you have learned how to code
        without formal education or training, yet by doing so I have relied on your
        own initiative, curiosity, and persistence to acquire the skills and
        knowledge you need to build software.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Being self-taught means that I have developed a strong sense of self-discipline, resourcefulness, and problem-solving skills
        that can be valuable assets in the workplace. With dedication and hard
        work, I have achieved succes and am building a career in the tech industry.
